# kakao_AI_study

This repository includes various study projects and examples for AI and machine learning with a focus on data science, natural language processing, and machine learning models.

## Requirements

To use the notebooks and scripts in this repository, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SQLite
- Selenium (for web scraping)
- Textblob (for text analysis)
- scikit-learn (for ML models)


## Contents


### DataScience_Basic
Projects cover data collection using APIs, statistical methods with Pandas and NumPy, and basic database management using SQLite.
- **Example**: Includes applications used on a personal blog to demonstrate practical uses.

### Text_and_NLP
Examples and projects in this section include web scraping, text preprocessing, analysis, and visualization (e.g., word clouds). Additional examples use APIs for translation.
- **Tools**: Primarily uses Selenium for scraping, along with natural language processing libraries.

### ML (Machine Learning)
  - **Regression Models**: Least Squares Estimation, Logistic Regression
  - **Advanced Models**: Gradient Boosting (aseemble model for regression and classification)
  - **Classification Models**: Kernelized SVM, KNN
  - **Unsupervised Learning**: k-means clustering
  - **Dimensionality Reduction** : PCA
